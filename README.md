# etch-a-sketch

This is a project from the Odin Project course.

The goal is to create a Etch-A-Sketch like game by utilizing Dom Manipulation.

The project uses minimal html to create the general layout and basic css to styleize. From here DOM elements such as the grid layout are created using JS. Additional elements are included such as event listeners to allow interactivity with the button to generate new grid layouts.
